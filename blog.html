									<p>Considered one of China’s most livable and beautiful cities, Nanjing has a population of eight million – small by Chinese standards! It therefore offers a more relaxed atmosphere than giant cities such as Beijing and Shanghai, as well as lower living costs, and has a fine landscape of scenic lakes, lush green parks and small mountains.

There’s a lot to see, from attractive imperial-era landmarks such as the Linggu Temple and the Chaotian Palace, to more recent works such as the 450-metre (1,480 ft) tall Zifeng Tower or the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum. Nanjing also has a vibrant, well-established nightlife (unsurprisingly including plenty of karaoke joints), and hosts events such as the International Plum Blossom Festival.

The educational center of southern China for more than 1,700 years, the city has a large range of prestigious higher education institutions and research institutes and a large student population. Although the majority of courses are taught in Mandarin, some universities do offer English-taught programs.

									<p>Living in one of the biggest countries, with the largest population in the world, life in china can be an overwhelming experience for most people. When international students decide to study in China, many of them worry about the way of life in China is completely different from their home countries, and they may have hard time to adapt their new study life in China.
Today’s life in China is not so much different from anywhere else in the world. If students are studying in major cities like Shanghai and Beijing, the lifestyle of local people has been strongly influenced by western culture. You can easily find western fast food restaurants, supermarkets and department stores.

When students leave their countries, they are embarking on a journey that will take them to places that are different from their usual way of life. Students should try to be flexible and enjoy the unexpected. Embrace new people and culture around you. Sample the food, try to speak the language, ask questions; your study abroad experience in China will be full of happy memories. <br>

  <strong>Expenses</strong>
Students should open local bank account in China if they are studying in China for more than three months. Foreign students can easily open bank accounts in China. <br>

<strong> Money Exchange</strong>
Exchange rates fluctuate in line with international financial market condition and are published daily by the State Exchange Control Administration. <br>

<strong>Insurance</strong>
It is required by the ministry of education in China that Insurance is required for all foreign students who pursues higher education in China for a period over six months. <br>

Communications
Students will largely rely on mobile phone as a medium of communications with your newly met Chinese friends during your stay in China.

									<p>Students looking to study abroad have an increasing number of options and China is becoming more and more popular, according to research from Student.com, which provides accommodation for international students. Here are five reasons to consider joining the throngs of international students already there.

<strong>1. You’ll be joining a growing trend</strong>
China is an increasingly popular destination for students from around the world, with the number of international students in China doubling in the past 10 years.

China is already the fourth most popular destination for travel generally and has the third-largest population of international students, behind the US and the UK.

This number has been growing by an average of 10 per cent a year for the past 10 years, a far quicker growth rate than any other popular study-abroad destination.
<br><br>
<strong>2. There are more options than ever</strong>
Over the past 10 years, international visitors and students have been going “deeper” into China, choosing to travel to a wider range of cities than before.

In the past, Shanghai and Beijing were the only cities where it was common to see international students.

In 2006, nearly 50 per cent of international students were in Beijing or Shanghai, but this has fallen to 32 per cent.

Today, there are 13 cities across China with more than 10,000 international students, with seven cities having more than 20,000 students.

Popular cities include Guangdong in the south of China and Liaoning, north of Beijing. <br><br>

  <strong>3. Chinese universities have a growing reputation</strong>
Whether you intend to secure a graduate job or continue studying at postgraduate level, the reputation of your university is important for your future prospects.

Chinese universities are increasingly well respected; the number included in major global university rankings has risen significantly over the past five years, particularly compared with the UK, which has fallen in many rankings.

In 2011, there were only six Chinese universities in Times Higher Education’s World University Rankings, whereas in 2015-2016 there were 37, more than either Canada or Australia. <br><br>
<strong>4. The government is investing heavily in international students</strong>
Financial support is an important factor in the decision to study abroad and the Chinese government is offering a wide range of funding opportunities to attract international students, including more than 40,000 scholarships at 277 institutions.

In 2015, 40 per cent of all international students new to China received government sponsorship. The number of scholarships available has increased fivefold since 2006.<br><br>
<strong>5. It could be great for your career</strong>
Knowledge and experience of China is an increasingly valuable asset in many industries.

As the fourth most popular destination for international travel, with nearly 12 million business trips to China in 2015, the country is growing in economic and cultural significance.

Experience of China and Chinese, which is the third most popular language to learn in the world, could give you a great career boost.

Marie Rosszell, an international student at the University of Macau, secured a job with Google in Japan partly as a result of her international experiences. Read her blog here.

Gracibelt Rendon, who chose to study in China to differentiate herself from others in the workplace, explains: “There is a saying that my friends who went to university together share, which is; if you survive living in China, you can survive and be prepared to face anything in the world.

“[The experience] allows you to be an open-minded person, ready to adapt and be flexible, which at the end of the day is what every employer is looking for. Studying in China gives you experience about how things work in this part of the world and helps you to become more independent.”
